      <header class="section-header">Rationale for Summative Assessment</header>
      <p> Summative assessment is an evaluation of the learning that has taken place in a given period of a course. Summative assessment is not a generalized assessment of student ability compared to arbitrarily chosen standards outside of the course content such as IELTS or TOEFL. When building standard assessments you must consider the following factors:.</p>
        <div class="paragraph-list"> 
          <ul>
          <li>The content that has been explicitly covered in your class</li>
          <li>The content that has been covered by all teachers teaching the course</li>
          <li>The content aligns with the standards that are outlined in the course pacing guide for this assessment period.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <p> Summative assessments should not assess content or skills that have not been covered in the course, or are not in the assumed skillset for the student level. The exam should not assess content and skills that were only covered in some of the classes taking this course.  </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="General_Formatting">
      <header class="section-header">General Formatting</header>
      <p><b><code>Fonts</code></b></p> 
      <p>Times New Roman typeface should be used consistently throughout the paper. </p>
      <p> Font-size should generally be set at 12 points, but may be set as low as 10 points.</p>
      <p><b><code>Line Spacing and Indentation</code></b></p>
      <p>Single line spacing  for longer bodies of text is appropriate as long as indentation and question spacing allows for students to easily discern between reading passages, instructions, question stems, question responses. 1.15 point spacing is also appropriate. It is recommended that there are at least two differentiating factors between adjacent bodies of text.</p>
      <div class=paragraph-list>
      <ul>
        <li>Example 1: Question responses are differentiated from question stems by letter headings (A,B,C,D), and indentation. </li>
        <li> Example 2: Reading passages are differentiated from prompts by a full line break and title or text heading. </li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <p><b><code>Question Spacing</code></b></p>
      <p> There should be a clear space between questions (minimum 0.5 points).</p>
      <p><b><code>Margins</code></b></p>
      <p> Margins should be set as “Normal” (2.54cm) on all sides. </p>
      <p><b><code>Question Numbering & Lettering</code></b></p>
      <p>All questions should have discreet continuous numbers starting at 1. Continuing to increase with no repetition throughout the various sections of the test. Numbering should use a consistent format throughout the test. “1.” Is recommended. Other acceptable formats include “(1)”, “Question 1”, etc. Letters for response alternatives should be capitalized and indented.</p>
      <p>Example: 1.	This is my example question stem. How should question alternatives be formatted?</p>   
      <div class="paragraph-list">
        <ol type="A">
      <li>Roman numerals and indentation</li>
      <li>Capital letters and indentation</li>
      <li>Lower-case letters and line breaks</li>
      </ol>
      </div>
      <p><b><code>Acronyms</code></b></p>
      <p>Avoid using acronyms when possible. If a term will only be used once,  use the expanded form even if you assume students are familiar with the acronym. If a longer term will be used several times in a reading passage, or in instructions, you can introduce the acronym in parentheses in an obvious way. For example multiple choice questions can be abbreviated as (MCQ), but this abbreviation should be introduced in the section heading.</p>
      <p><b><code>Capitalization</code></b></p>
      <p>MCQ question alternatives should not start with capital letters unless there is an explicit reason related to the grammar of the question. For example a gap fill question where the gap is placed at the start of a sentence. In this case, all alternatives should start with capital letter. </p>

      <p><b>Reading</b></p>
      <p> Shorter reading tasks include, reading a sentence and answering a multiple choice, arranging a paragraph, composing a topic sentence for a series of supporting sentences, etc. It takes students lots of energy and time to read a passage, especially longer passages, so it is important that we do not waste that energy. Longer passages can have more than one task and question type. Longer passages should not have large chunks of text that do not relate to any questions. Some low-level tasks for longer passages include scanning for dates and names and identifying transition or other types of signal phrases, skimming for topic; medium-level tasks include skimming for main idea, identifying vocabulary meaning from context, etc.; high-level task include synthesising ideas, extrapolating line of reasoning etc.</p>
